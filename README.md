# BotAI-ChatBot
React based AI ChatBot


Overview

To complete this assessment, you will need to write a ReactJS web application.

The purpose of this assessment is to assess your skills and approach to composing a simple
web application.

This assessment is expected to take about 6-12 hours to complete.

What to do?

Your goal is to implement an application where the user can chat with an AI model. Beyond
this, the user should be able to give some feedback at each stage of the conversation.

This feedback is multi-fold.
- The user should be able to like/dislike the AI model's answer using the thumbs
up/thumbs down buttons. These buttons are hidden and float when the mouse
hovers over the AI model's response.
- The user should be able to give a rating out of 5 at the end of the conversation. You
can get creative here and use a likert scale, or 5 stars, etc.
- The user should be able to give subjective feedback at the end of the conversation.

The user should be able to have multiple such conversations.

Once the user is done having that conversation, the chat gets saved. This chat can be
revisited from a panel on the side/top bar. While viewing a past conversation, the user
should also be able to see the feedback provided. 

There should be another view where the user can see all feedback points across
conversations and filter them based on rating. You need to think about the design here. One
option is to show the feedback generated in a table, where each row is the feedback related
to one conversation. This makes sorting/filtering easier. You can get creative here!

Although it's a very basic exercise, we will be looking for easy to navigate, well-designed,
well-commented and tested code in the submission. UI/UX is key! Use a UI library like
Material etc.

You can mock the AI model response from a custom JSON file which includes the response for a particular question.

Sample Data 

NOTE: You can use the above sample data and add more key, value pairs if needed. The data present inside the above json file must be there for evaluation purposes.

Bonus Extensions:

• The user should be able to toggle between light and dark mode.

Guidelines:

• Choose any libraries that help you produce the highest quality work in the time
available.
• You can't do it all. We respect your time, and expect that you will have to make choices and trade-offs for what is in scope for your deliverable.
• Don't worry about authentication. Assume a non-authenticated experience to keep things simple.
• You should mock the data from a custom JSON file.
• Code should be readable, modular, testable & extensible.
• Write your README, including the following items:
o How to start the service and use the application 
o Reasoning behind your technical choices
o Reasoning behind your design choices
o Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
